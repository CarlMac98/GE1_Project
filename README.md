###*Games Engines 1 assignment - Carlo Macr√¨, D19123747*

##Description
The idea of the project is to mesh together procedural generation, music, gaming and a bit of psychedelia. The user will control a carachter that will be able to shot and interact with the objects in the scene. The whole world and objects will act as a sort of music visualizer and our protagonist, by interacting with flying objects (probably strange one-big-eyed creatures), will let them fall and divide into objects on earth still reacting on music. The number of flying creatures will be constant and they will be generated procedurally.

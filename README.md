# GE1_Project
### *Games Engines 1 assignment - Carlo Macr√¨, D19123747*

## Description
This project let us control a flying satellite/eye in an alien world (generated procedurally), full of bombs and music. The bombs react to music and there is a black sun floating upon the scene. By firing and hitting the bombs, these will go into the sun, getting destroyed. Still the number of bombs in the scene will be constant.
## Controls
You can control the PsyEyeSatellite with the following controls:

- W : forward
- A : left
- S : backward
- D : right
- MouseMovement : move visual
- E : increase altitude
- F : decrease altitude
- LShift : increase speed
- LeftMouse/Space : fire
## Further notes
I used some of the code written in class during the lessons by the professor modifying them, specifically:

- the Controller script, for the movement of the player
- the AudioAnalyzer 

I'm proud that this scene works in a proper way and it meshes procedural generation, music and classic TPS gameplay. With a further more work this could be a nice game or artistic experience.
